        <b>The sender and recipient each have unique public/private encryption and signing keys. 
            These keys are generated on the device by a FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic library 
            and are not controlled by the service provider. Each message uses a new symmetric key for message encryption. 
            Secure end-to-end signing and encryption protect all messages from eavesdropping or manipulation. Additionally, 
            TLS encryption protects the connections between the device and the service provider's infrastructure.</b>
